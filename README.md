## Description

Group Project #3 involved the creation of a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, and which fulfills the following requirements:

- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (JWT).
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
    
Our group elected to develop an application (which we refer to as "MoneyMaster") that helps the user to develop a monthly budget and track their expenses by category
